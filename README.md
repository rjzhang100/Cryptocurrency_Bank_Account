### What Will the Program Do?
First and foremost, the purpose of the program is to create a friendly interface where
users can track and maintain their cryptocurrencies. The program will provide details about
cryptocurrencies the user may have based on the user-inputted cryptocurrencies they may own. 
These details include trackers of each cryptocurrency's quantity, market value at a given time
and be able to display historical data of the currencies. There will also be a predicting 
feature in the program, which will, based on historical data of the currency, attempt to predict
the future change in prices of the currency. 

This program is to be used by people not only interested in learning more about cryptocurrencies,
but also for people to manage and organize their holdings.

### Who Will Use this Program?
This program is designed for anyone with crytocurrency holdings, or anyone wanting to 
get involved in cryptocurrencies. Outside of using it for organizing their own holdings,
they can also use the program to research historical data and consider the predictions
proposed by the program regarding trends in the data.

### Why is this Project of Interest to You?
From the start, I knew I wanted to try implementing a machine learning algorithm as part of my
assignment. With cryptocurrencies gaining traction more than ever, a wide pool of data is publicly 
available for use in training an algorithm. In addition, I've never really researched 
cryptocurrencies myself, or tried to learn what they really are. In writing this program,
I can also learn about how cryptocurrencies might interact in a market and hopefully
understand, at a fundamental level, what they are. As well, given the volatile and truthfully
unpredictable nature of cryptocurrencies, designing an effective prediction algorithm will 
demand some creativity; I hope to learn some new approaches and fully apply myself.
